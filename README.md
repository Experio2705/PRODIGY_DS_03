Task 03 â€“ Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
Objective
Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral attributes. The model uses the Bank Marketing dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

Tools & Technologies
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Workflow
Data Preparation

Loaded dataset (bank-additional.csv) into a DataFrame

Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and standardized formats

Feature Engineering & Selection

Identified key predictor variables (e.g., call duration, month, job, marital status)

Applied encoding (one-hot or label encoding) for categorical features

Model Training

Split data into training and testing sets

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn

Evaluation & Analysis

Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Analyzed feature importance to understand influential factors
